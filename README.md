## Vulnerable environment

To setup a vulnerable environment for your test you will need [Docker](https://docker.com) installed, and just run the following command:

    docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 vulnerables/cve-2016-10033

And it will spawn a vulnerable web application on your host on ```8080``` port

## Exploit

To exploit this target just run:

    ./exploit host:port

If you are using this vulnerable image, you can just run:

    ./exploit localhost:8080

After the exploitation, a file called backdoor.php will be stored on the root folder of the web directory. And the exploit will drop you a shell where you can send commands to the backdoor:



## Vulnerable code

Before this [commit](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/commit/4835657cd639fbd09afd33307cef164edf807cdc) in [class.phpmailer.php](https://github.com/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2016-10033/blob/master/src/class.phpmailer.php#L1446) in a certain scenarion there is no filter in the sender's email address special chars. This flaw can lead to a remote code execution, via ```mail``` function [here](https://github.com/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2016-10033/blob/master/src/class.phpmailer.php#L700).

To trigger this code, you need:

    * PHPMailer < 5.2.18
    * Compile PHP without PCRE.
    * PHP version must be inferior to 5.2.0.

So you can bypass the sender's email validation on ```validateAddress``` function, setting ```patternselect``` to ```noregex```. To make easier to archieve such environment I just changed it to [this code](https://github.com/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2016-10033/blob/master/src/class.phpmailer.php#L1102).
